To ease myself into the blogosphere I wanted to start with a break-the-ice style article before I jump into code-heavy posts.

Recently, I’ve been interviewing people for a front-end developer position and I’ve found it telling to ask the candidate about their preferred coding setup.<!--more--> I can usually get a feel for where their priorities lie—how much they care about organization and efficient coding. Sometimes their answer is better than their resume at conveying how advanced they are. So allow me to introduce myself through my own setup. These are the tools I use to keep my workflow flowing.

## Sublime Text 2

![Sublime Text 2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2013/03/Sublime-Text-2.png) I’ve worked with quite a few different text editors (DreamWeaver, Coda, TextMate, UltraEdit, Eclipse...), but Sublime gets my money for its simplicity, plethora of packages and JSON style settings pages. Coupled with the Emmet (previously Zen Coding) plugin, sometimes it feels like I can get the code down faster than I can think it. Sublime Text 2 makes organizing and searching in projects a breeze. I also appreciate the little touches: the vertical lines that show indentation levels, dots and dashes to indicate spacing and tabs and the birds eye view of the code on the right for easy navigation.

## CodeKit

![CodeKit]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2013/03/codekit.png) CodeKit does all my heavy lifting. It compiles SASS (or any other preprocessor) files, combines and minifies JavaScript, optimizes .jpgs and .pngs, watches the project and reloads my browser and much more. I used to use LiveReload, which gets an honourable mention. In fact, if you’re FTPing, it has a handy delay so the files have time to upload before the browser refresh. But I develop locally whenever possible and I just love the CodeKit UI and all the extra bells and whistles.

* CodeKit free trial and $25 download at [incident57.com/codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit).
* LiveReload $9.99 at [livereload.com](http://livereload.com).

## MAMP

![MAMP]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2013/03/mamp.png) Speaking of developing locally, MAMP is a free app that lets me run a local server and manage databases without connecting to the interweb. While standard MAMP takes care of all my needs, you can also upgrade to MAMP Pro for $56.82.

## iTerm

![iTerm]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2013/03/iTerm.png) I’m not a huge command line user. I use it to navigate around my computer, SSH onto various servers (occasionally tweaking the odd database) and to interact with GitHub. iTerm 2 comes with a whole host of [features](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/features) but I’ll admit that right now I’m mainly using it to make my terminal window look good.

* iTerm2 is free at [iterm2.com](http://www.iterm2.com).

## IcoMoon

If you’re not taking advantage of icon fonts, please start right now! Having a scaleable, CSS editable set of icons is amazing. Here are the top three reasons that you should use IcoMoon to manage those icons.


1 A custom icon set means that you only have the icons you want. Don’t make computers download an entire set of icons if you’re only going to us five of them.
2 You can create your own icons, save them as an SVG and upload them to IcoMoon to include in your custom icon font. Or you can edit existing icons in the app.
3 You are able to save and load your sessions at any time.

Unbelievably this webapp is free with the option to upgrade to essential and ultimate packs for $39 and $59 respectively.

## Slicy

![Slicy]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2013/03/slicy.png) If you ever convert Photoshop documents into web pages this app will absolutely change your life and is worth every penny of the $29 price tag. It works like this: you have a photoshop file of a web page mock-up. Instead of slicing it up or hiding layers and trimming, all you do is rename the asset layers to something like star.png or picure.jpg. Then you re-save the .psd and drag it onto the Slicy UI and presto, it spits out all the images—perfectly sliced. Then you save them to a folder and, if you want, it will automatically re-output those images if the Photoshop document is saved again. It doesn’t just stop at layers. You can rename groups and even use layer masks to adjust the output. You can use different naming conventions to output @2x or half size versions for your retina needs.

I’ll admit, I don’t use Photoshop as much as I used to, but this app saves me a boatload of time whenever I do.

## VMware Fusion

![VMWare Fusion](http://camelcas.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fusion.png) Let’s face it, we’re still going to be testing in old versions of IE for a while. As a Mac user, this involves finding a way to view your project on a Windows environment. For the longest time, I had an old laptop that I ran IETester on but this meant a lot of back and forth. It became obvious that I needed a more comprehensive solution. I started my search with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), a free, open source option. VirtualBox was fine, but it was a ginormous download and a bit clunky to run. After that it was a toss-up between [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) ($49.99) and [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/ca) ($79.95). I tried VMware first and, although Parallels sounds great, I didn’t bother comparing and went for the cheaper option.

* Oracle VM VirtualBox is free at [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org).
* VMware Fusion free trial and $49.99 software at [vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html).
* Parallels is $79.95 at [parallels.com/ca](http://www.parallels.com/ca).

Of course, this list isn’t exhaustive by any means; these are just the apps I use regularly. What apps do you use in your day-to-day coding?
