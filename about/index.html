  <p><span data-typography="C">Camel Cases is a collection of articles</span> and code snippets written by me, Daniel Sundy. What qualifies me to publish things on the internet? Nothing formal (unless you count the English degree that’s rolled up in a drawer in my parents’ basement), but I spend most of my day wading through HTML, CSS and JavaSript at Helios Design Labs in Toronto, Canada. I’m hoping that I can give back a little bit to the design and development community by passing on some of the solutions I find.</p>
